## Business Structure (LLC, Sole Proprietor) {#business-structure}

### Do you NEED an LLC?

**Short answer: No**, but it's recommended for liability protection.

### Options for Shopify App Developers:

#### 1. **Sole Proprietorship** (Easiest to start)
**Pros:**
- No registration required (use your personal info)
- Simplest tax filing (Schedule C on personal taxes)
- Lowest cost ($0 to start)
- Good for testing the market

**Cons:**
- **No liability protection** (personal assets at risk)
- Less professional appearance
- Harder to get business bank account
- Can't take on investors easily

**Best for:** Side projects, testing the market, first-time app developers

#### 2. **LLC (Limited Liability Company)** (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- **Personal liability protection** (your house, car, savings protected)
- Professional image (builds trust with merchants)
- Tax flexibility (can choose S-Corp election later)
- Easier to sell business later
- Can get business bank account and credit cards

**Cons:**
- Costs $50-$500 to register (varies by state)
- Annual fees ($0-$800/year depending on state)
- More paperwork (annual reports, separate taxes)
- Takes 1-4 weeks to set up

**Best for:** Serious app developers, anyone planning to grow

**Cheapest states for LLC:**
- Wyoming: $50/year
- New Mexico: $50 registration
- Delaware: $90/year (popular for tech)
- Nevada: No state income tax

**How to set up LLC:**
1. Choose a state (usually your home state or WY/DE/NV)
2. File Articles of Organization ($50-$500)
3. Get EIN from IRS (free, online, 5 minutes)
4. Open business bank account
5. Update Shopify Partners account with LLC info

**Services to help:**
- Northwest Registered Agent: $39 + state fees
- Incfile: $0 + state fees (upsells other services)
- ZenBusiness: $49 + state fees
- LegalZoom: $79 + state fees

#### 3. **Corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp)** (For serious businesses)
**Not recommended** for most app developers unless:
- Raising venture capital
- Have multiple shareholders
- Planning significant growth (100+ merchants)

### Tax Implications

**Sole Proprietor:**
- Pay self-employment tax (15.3%) + income tax
- Report income on Schedule C (personal taxes)
- Quarterly estimated taxes required

**LLC (default pass-through):**
- Same as sole proprietor tax-wise
- But liability protection
- Can elect S-Corp status to save on taxes (if profitable)

**LLC with S-Corp election:**
- Pay yourself reasonable salary (subject to payroll taxes)
- Take remaining profits as distributions (no self-employment tax)
- **Saves ~$3,000-10,000/year** if making $50k+ profit
- Requires payroll service (~$40/month)

### Recommendation for Bike Builder App:

**Starting out (Year 1):**
- Start as **Sole Proprietor** to test the market
- Keep it simple, focus on getting merchants
- Costs: $0

**Once profitable ($1,000+/month revenue):**
- Form an **LLC** for liability protection
- Delaware or Wyoming if you want privacy
- Your home state if you want simplicity
- Costs: $50-500 initial, $0-800/year ongoing

**If making $50k+/year profit:**
- Consider **S-Corp election** for tax savings
- Hire accountant (~$1,500/year)
- Use payroll service like Gusto (~$40/month)
